Projects  

1. Customer Churn Prediction  
This project focuses on predicting customer churnâ€”identifying customers who are likely to discontinue a service. By leveraging machine learning models such as Logistic Regression,  Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forests, I analyze key customer behavior patterns and risk factors. The goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that helps businesses improve customer retention strategies.  

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection  
In this crucial project, I focus on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by applying machine learning techniques. Using algorithms like Logistic Regression,I aim to refine my skills in anomaly detection. This hands-on experience provides valuable exposure to real-world financial security challenges and the role of machine learning in fraud prevention.  

3. Spam SMS Detection  
Spam messages often attempt to mislead users into sharing sensitive information or engaging with malicious content. Traditional rule-based approaches struggle to keep up with evolving fraudulent patterns. In this project, I develop a model to detect spam messages using the Logistic Regression,TfidfVectorizer . By integrating natural language processing with machine learning, this project aims to enhance security by effectively filtering out fraudulent SMS messages.  

About the Internship  
The CODSOFT machine learning internship is an immersive experience designed to provide hands-on exposure to diverse machine learning applications. Over this month-long journey, I have explored both theoretical concepts and practical implementations while working with real-world datasets.  

My primary goal has been to strengthen my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of various machine learning algorithms, and learn how to transform raw data into meaningful insights. Iâ€™m eager to apply these learnings to real-world problems and contribute to the field of machine learning.  

Feel free to explore my projects, share feedback, or connect with me if you have a keen interest in machine learning and data science. Thanks for being a part of this journey!
